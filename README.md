# Solution to Poisson on Mesh using FEM
This repo contains the implementation of sovling Poisson equation on mesh using Finite Element Method. 
Here are a few results. 
#### Laplace Equation
$$-\nabla u =0 $$

#### Poisson Equation
$$-\nabla u = x^2-y^2 $$

#### Poisson Equation
$$-\nabla u = 10sin(x) * 10sin(y) $$
